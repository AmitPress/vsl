# VSL Math Library

This package implements Math functions. It provides two different backends:

- One using `vsl.vmath.vimpl` when using flag `-d vmath`.
  This is an alternative implementation of the
  standard math library written from scratch in pure V.
- One using `vlib/math` as backend, *by default*.
