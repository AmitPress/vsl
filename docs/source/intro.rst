Introduction
************

The V Scientific Library (VSL) is a pure scientific V library with a wide variety of
mathematical functions and operations. It's a collection of routines for
numerical computing written from scratch in V. It is free software under the MIT License.

Routines available in VSL
=========================

Routines are available for the following areas,

===========================  ===========================  ===========================
Mathematical Functions       Complex Numbers              Special Functions
Roots finding                Polynomials
Quaternions                  Differential Equations       Numerical Differentiation
Graph theory structure       Physical Constants           Easing Functions
===========================  ===========================  ===========================

Each chapter of this manual
provides detailed definitions of the functions, followed by examples
and references to the articles and other resources on which the 
algorithms are based.

Conventions used in this manual
===============================

   single: dollar sign $, shell prompt

This manual contains many examples which can be typed at the keyboard.
A command entered at the terminal is shown like this::

    $ command

The first character on the line is the terminal prompt, and should not
be typed.  The dollar sign $ is used as the standard prompt in
this manual, although some systems may use a different character.

The examples assume the use of the GNU operating system.  There may be
minor differences in the output on other systems.  The commands for
setting environment variables use the Bourne shell syntax of the
standard GNU shell (:code:`bash`).
